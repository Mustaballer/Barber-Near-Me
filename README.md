# Barber Near Me

This is a full-stack web app that utilizes Mapbox as the frontend and geocode for the backend to add and display nearby barber locations on a 
user friendly map. Compared to offical barbershops, non-licensed and amateur barbers can add their locations particularly in these 
pressing times.
